# ProjectEuler.net Solutions in Ruby, JavaScript, and Objective-C

## Overview
The purpose of this repo is for me to practice my programming chops in various languages that interest me.  

For each language (Ruby, JavaScript, Objective-C), I will be providing solutions and tests.  

I'm currently available for hire. You can checkout my portfolio at www.ricardo.io
