# ProjectEuler.net
## Solutions in Ruby, JavaScript, and Objective-C

## Overview
The purpose of this repo is for me to practice my programming chops in various languages that interest me.  

For each language (Ruby, JavaScript, Objective-C), I will be providing solutions and tests.  

## Environments
Ruby
- Ruby v1.9.3
- RSpec v2.14.8  

JavaScript
- Node v0.10.6
- Mocha (test runner) and Chai (assertion library)

Objective-C
- OCUnit for testing

## Instructions
Filenames should match problem ids on www.projecteuler.net  

If you want to find the solution for problem 1 from projecteuler.net, then go
into the folder of the language you want the answer in.  

ex: I want the answer to problem001 on projecteuler in Ruby.
Navigate to the ruby folder and look at problem001.rb  

I can also run the spec for problem001.rb by typing in the following:

```
rspec problem001_spec.rb
```
